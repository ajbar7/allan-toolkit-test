# NationalMap

NationalMap is a website for map-based access to government spatial data. It is designed to:

* Provide easy access to data for government, business and the public
* Integrate datasets into a ‘front end map’ for data.gov.au
* Provide an open framework of geospatial data services that supports commercial and community innovation
* Provide agencies with an easy map to embed on their own websites

NationalMap is an initiative of the Australian Commonwealth Government's Department of Communications. The software was developed by Data61 working closely with the Department and Geoscience Australia.
