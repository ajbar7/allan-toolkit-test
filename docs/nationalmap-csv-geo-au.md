csv-geo-au is a specification for publishing point or region-mapped Australian geospatial data in CSV format. Datasets in this format are supported by National Map and are intended to be as reusable as possible.

Publishing data using this specification will allow tabular data to be displayed as a layer on the NationalMap. 

More information about csv-geo-au, including supported regions, [is available here](https://github.com/TerriaJS/nationalmap/wiki/csv-geo-au).

## csv-geo-au and data.gov.au

Any dataset containing a csv-geo-au formatted csv will be made available through NationalMap's catalogue. However, you will need to ensure that the format of the file is set to csv-geo-au on the resource upload page.
