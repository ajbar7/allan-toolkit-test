## Public Data Policy Statement
The Public Data Policy Statement was released on the 7 December 2016.  You can download the full statement on the [Department’s website](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/public-data/public-data-policy).

The statement commits Australian Government entities to;
 
* make non-sensitive data open by default to contribute to greater innovation and productivity improvements across all sectors of the Australian economy;
* where possible, make data available with free, easy to use, high quality and reliable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs);
* make high-value data available for use by the public, industry and academia, in a manner that is enduring and frequently updated using high quality standards;
* where possible, ensure non-sensitive publicly funded research data is made open for use and reuse;
* only charge for specialised data services and, where possible, publish the resulting data open by default;
* build partnerships with the public, private and research sectors to build collective expertise and to find new ways to leverage public data for social and economic benefit;
* securely share data between Australian Government entities to improve efficiencies, and inform policy development and decision-making;
* engage openly with the States and Territories to share and integrate data to inform matters of importance to each jurisdiction and at the national level;
* uphold the highest standards of security and privacy for the individual, national security and commercial confidentiality; and
* ensure all new systems support discoverability, interoperability, data and information accessibility and cost-effective access to facilitate access to data.
