# Open Data Toolkit

The Open Data Toolkit can help, with simple and practical information on how your agency can make its data open, and why it’s worth doing.

The toolkit is compromised of four sections:

* **Getting Started**
* **Planning**
* **Publishing your data**
* **Using data.gov.au**

## Public Data Policy Statement

The Public Data Policy Statement was released on the 7 December 2016.  You can download the full statement on the [Department’s website](https://www.dpmc.gov.au/public-data/public-data-policy).

The statement commits Australian Government entities to;

* make non-sensitive data open by default to contribute to greater innovation and productivity improvements across all sectors of the Australian economy;
* where possible, make data available with free, easy to use, high quality and reliable Application Programming Interfaces (APIs);
* make high-value data available for use by the public, industry and academia, in a manner that is enduring and frequently updated using high quality standards;
* where possible, ensure non-sensitive publicly funded research data is made open for use and reuse;
* only charge for specialised data services and, where possible, publish the resulting data open by default;
* build partnerships with the public, private and research sectors to build collective expertise and to find new ways to leverage public data for social and economic benefit;
* securely share data between Australian Government entities to improve efficiencies, and inform policy development and decision-making;
* engage openly with the States and Territories to share and integrate data to inform matters of importance to each jurisdiction and at the national level;
* uphold the highest standards of security and privacy for the individual, national security and commercial confidentiality; and
* ensure all new systems support discoverability, interoperability, data and information accessibility and cost-effective access to facilitate access to data.

### At a minimum, Australian Government entities will publish appropriately anonymised government data by default:

* on or linked through data.gov.au for discoverability and availability;
* in a machine-readable, spatially-enabled format;
* with high quality, easy to use and freely available API access;
* with descriptive metadata;
* using agreed open standards;
* kept up to date in an automated way; and
* under a Creative Commons By Attribution licence unless a clear case is made.
