# Creating an account

Anyone can browse, download or use an API from data.gov.au without creating an account. 

Government users that require the ability to publish a dataset will need to create an account and request publishing privileges. To create an account click the Register link at the top right of any page (*or, point your browser to https://data.gov.au/user/register*) and complete the form. You only need to complete the username, email, password and confirm [*password*] fields. 

We recommend that you use a group email account for managing your presence on data.gov.au.

# Requesting publishing privileges

If your organisation already has a presence on data.gov.au you will need to request publishing privileges from your organisation’s administrator. If you are unsure who the administrator is send us an email.

If your organisation does not have a publishing presence on data.gov.au you will need to request a data publishing account to be established by sending us an email. Before emailing a request you’ll require approval from an appropriate senior delegate. We strongly recommend that you do not use an individual’s email address for the main management account for your data.gov.au organisation. 

Once internal approval has been granted send the text below to data@pmc.gov.au:

> On behalf of the **<entity name>**, I request a data publishing account on data.gov.au. **<entity name>** will be responsible for the management of this account and the data that is published using it.

> **<entity name>** will notify the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (DPMC) to any changes in ownership of the account and of any issues if they arise. The responsibility of publishing data appropriately, in accordance with privacy, security and other relevant considerations rests entirely with the data publisher and DPMC take no responsibility.

> I have registered the account name **<account name>** with email address **<email address>** on data.gov.au and request access to publish data.

> I understand that DPMC intends to continue to provide data.gov.au as a whole of government data publishing platform at no cost to government data publishers. If circumstances change, DPMC will give publishers appropriate notice. 

> DPMC will also provide documentation and minimal free technical support to data publishers.
